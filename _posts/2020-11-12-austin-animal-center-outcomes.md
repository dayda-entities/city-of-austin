Animal Center Outcomes from Oct, 1st 2013 to present.  Outcomes represent the status of animals as they leave the Animal Center.  All animals receive a unique Animal ID during intake.  Annually over 90% of animals entering the center, are adopted, transferred to rescue or returned to their owners.  The Outcomes data set reflects that Austin, TX. is the largest "No Kill" city in the country.

This data set replaces all previous Animal Center Outcomes data sets.
