This dataset was created by the City of Austin to compile information regarding all  sign/banner permits folders in AMANDA. The dataset contains information regarding the type, size, applicant, and location of the sign and permit. It also includes geographic information like Council District and Jurisdiction Type. 

The point dataset contains information regarding issued sign/banner permits that were created if the permit is tied to a property. Information in this dataset has been retrieved from the City's Application MANagement and Data Automation (AMANDA) database. The dataset contains information on location, banner direction, illumination type, variance requirement, installation date, type of sign, and removal date.
