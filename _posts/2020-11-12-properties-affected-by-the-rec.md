Dataset of all properties affected by the Recycling Diversion requirements of the Universal Recycling Ordinance. Affected commercial and multi-family properties are required to provide convenient access to recycling for tenants and employees. Each affected property is also required to file an annual report (Annual Diversion Plan) documenting compliance with the URO. All commercial and multi-family properties with more than 4 dwelling units in Austin are affected by the URO. The URO supports Austin's Zero Waste goal by requiring affected property and business owners to ensure that tenants and employees have convenient access to waste diversion.
