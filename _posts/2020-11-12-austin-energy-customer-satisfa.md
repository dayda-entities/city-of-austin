Austin Energy is proactive in addressing customer needs and regularly monitors customer satisfaction through customer surveys. In recent years, overall customer satisfaction has gone down. The drivers of the lower satisfaction are customer perceptions of price and value resulting from an overall increase in utility bills, despite Austin Energy providing reasonable and affordable electric rates. Residential and Commercial surveys are conducted quarterly while key account surveys are administered annually. Find more information at http://austinenergy.com/go/reports.
