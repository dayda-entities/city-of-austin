This dataset contains survey responses collected during an open data project in Fall 2016. The project goal was to get a better understanding of the Cityâ€™s open data strengths and opportunities. To do this, custom surveys were designed to learn more about the City's key performance indicators and the data that powers them. For more information about this project, visit http://open-data-sprints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project-open-data-plans.html
