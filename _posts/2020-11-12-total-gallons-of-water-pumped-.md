This dataset calculates the annual average gallons of water pumped per capita per day (GPCD) as a measure of Austinâ€™s water conservation efforts over time. GPCD is calculated as the total water pumped annually from Austin Water's potable water treatment plants, divided by Austin Water's estimated potable service area population and the number of days in the year. 

Data sources:  Austin Water potable treatment plant meters, U.S. Census Bureau, City of Austin Customer Care & Billing System (CC&B), and the City of Austin Demographer.
