This data set tracks the number of established businesses, non-profits, and startups that the City of Austin Economic Development and Small and Minority Business Resources departments supported each year. The data set lists the programs each business was served through, the race or ethnicity of the CEO or Executive supported, and zipcode, if available. This data can be used to distinguish areas of Austin and around the globe that have received small business services as well as the racial makeup of the executives of these established businesses, non-profits, and startups.
