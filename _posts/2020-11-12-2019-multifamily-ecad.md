ECAD Multifamily Audit and EUI Data as of November 13, 2019
This report is the result of the Austin City Code 6-7's Energy Conservation Audit and Disclosure Ordinance approved in November 2008 (amended in April 2011) to improve the energy efficiency of homes and buildings that receive electricity from Austin Energy. The ordinance meets one of the goals of the Austin Climate Protection Plan, which is to offset 1200 megawatts of Peak Energy by 2025.
The Audit results are averages of the energy efficiency measures evaluated on site during the audit.
