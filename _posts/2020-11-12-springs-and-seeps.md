Critical environmental features (CEFs) are defined in the City of Austin Land Development Code 25-8-1. Spring critical environmental features (CEFs) were digitized from construction plans, environmental assessments and City of Austin staff review and field observations. Seeps are not protected as CEFs but are noted for reference.
