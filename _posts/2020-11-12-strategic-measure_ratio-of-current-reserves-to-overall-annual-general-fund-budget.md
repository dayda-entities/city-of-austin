The Annual Budget Document provides information about the General Fund Reserve as a percentage of the total General Fund requirements (SD23 measure GTW.A.5). The General Fund Reserve ensures the City is capable of offsetting potential downturns in revenue sources and provides a sufficient cash balance for daily financial needs.

This dataset contains fields for fund ending balances, total requirements, budgets, and transfers.
