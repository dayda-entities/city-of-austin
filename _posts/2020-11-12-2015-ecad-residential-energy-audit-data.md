This report is the result of Austin City Code 6-7’s Energy Conservation Audit and Disclosure Ordinance approved in November 2008 (amended in April 2011) to improve the energy efficiency of homes and buildings that receive electricity from Austin Energy. The ordinance meets one of the goals of the Austin Climate Protection Plan, which is to offset 800 megawatts of peak energy demand by 2020. This report contains information on residential dwellings that have reported the results of the ECAD audit (*) to the City of Austin during 2015. For information on ECAD exemptions and other requirements, see Austin City Code Chapter 6-7.
