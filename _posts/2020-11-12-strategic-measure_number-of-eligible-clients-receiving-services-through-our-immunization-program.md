This dataset contains the number of Vaccine for Children (VFC) and adult safety net (ASN) eligible client visits and the number of shots given through the Austin Public Health ‘Shots for Tots’ and ‘Big Shots’ programs at the St. John's and Far South clinics. Data are reported monthly from 2010 through 2018.

The data were extracted from the Texas Department of State Health Services’ Texas-Wide Integrated Client Encounter System (TWICES) into an aggregate report for each clinic by an Austin Public Health employee at the beginning of each month.
