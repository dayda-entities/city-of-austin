This dataset contains information about the annual Adopted Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Tax Rate as a Percentage of the Effective O&M Tax Rate for the same fiscal year (SD23 measure GTW.A.3).  

The effective O&M tax rate is the tax rate that would produce the same amount of taxes as the previous year if applied to the same properties taxed in the previous year that are still on the tax roll. A percentage higher than 100% indicates the adopted O&M tax rate is higher than the effective O&M tax rate, whereas a percentage lower than 100% indicates the adopted O&M tax rate is lower than the effective O&M tax rate. This data is used for budget planning and review purposes.
