The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a telephone survey conducted annually by Texas Department of State Health Services to assess a variety of health measures within the state.  The survey data assesses whether participants have health insurance coverage and uses that data to provide an estimate of insurance coverage across Travis County residents.  The measure used refers to residents who are between 18-64 years of age.
